# MRV-Blue-Carbon-Project-LAC-2025
The goal is to produce accurate, scalable, and reproducible carbon stock estimates to support countriesâ€™ Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) obligations under climate agreements.

## Project Overview
The degradation of mangrove ecosystems across Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) presents a significant challenge for climate mitigation and blue carbon preservation. However, current national capacities to measure and report on mangrove carbon stocks, particularly above-ground biomass (AGB) and soil organic carbon (SOC), are often limited by data availability, inconsistent methodologies, and lack of scalable digital tools.
The problem is how to develop a standardized, scalable, and validated AI-driven MRV system for mangrove ecosystems that can produce reliable blue carbon stock estimates, support international reporting obligations, and enable sustainable blue carbon management in Latin America and the Caribbean. This consultancy also contributes to preparing countries for results-based payment schemes by producing standardized carbon estimates aligned with carbon credit market verification. While the core focus is on AGB estimation, methane data and modelling processes, when provided, will be integrated to enhance blue carbon stock accuracy. 
The project will use machine learning methods trained on high-resolution satellite data, LiDAR, field plots, and other auxiliary sources to produce validated, country-specific models. By piloting in Trinidad and scaling to Columbia, Jamaica, Panama, and Suriname, this initiative will enhance national reporting systems, support access to results-based climate finance, and build regional capacity for sustainable carbon monitoring. It directly contributes to climate reporting obligations under the Paris Agreement, while enabling future alignment with carbon credit verification standards.
